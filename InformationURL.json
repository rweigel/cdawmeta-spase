The Software and associated Database of SSCWeb together form a System to cast Geocentric Spacecraft Location Information into a Framework of Empirical Geophysical Regions and Mappings of Spacecraft Locations along Lines of the Earth's Magnetic Field. This Capability is one Key to Mission Science Planning, both Single Missions and Coordinated Observations of Multiple Spacecraft with Ground-Based Investigations, and to subsequent Multi-Mission Data Analysis."

These parameters were derived from a least squares fit to the ion number flux vs energy curve obtained by sweeping or stepping the voltage applied to the internal retarding grids of the RPA. In addition, a separate wide aperture sensor, a duct sensor, was flown to measure the spectral characteristics of iregularities in the total ion concentration. The measured parameters obtained from this investigation were important to the understanding of mechanisms that influence the plasma; i.e., to understand the coupling between the solar wind and the earth's atmosphere. The measurements were made with a multigridded planar retarding potential analyzer very similar in concept and geometry to the instruments carried on the AE satellites. The retarding potential was variable in the range from approximately +32 to 0 volts. The details of this voltage trace, and whether it was continuous or stepped, depended on the operating mode of the instrument. Specific parameters deduced from these measurements were ion temperature; vehicle potential; ram component of the ion drift velocity; the ion and electron concentration irregularity spectrum; and the concentration of H+, He+, O+, and Fe+, and of molecular ions near perigee. Additional details are in W. B. Hanson et al., Space Sci. Instrum., v. 5, n. 4, p. 503, 1981."

These Radars can measure the Position and Velocity of Plasma Irregularities in the Earth's Ionosphere, the highest Layer of the Earth's Atmosphere. The Movements of these Irregularities respond to Energy coupled into the Auroral Regions from the Solar Wind and the Magnetosphere. Therefore, SuperDARN Data provides Scientists with Information regarding the Earth's Interaction with the Space Environment."

About 60 modules exist, and 30 are supported as core modules that come with PaPCo. There are modules from 15+ spacecraft, including CRRES, Polar, Cassini and Cluster. Data from CDAWeb is plottable as well. The software is open-source, making it very flexible and well-suited for science use."
