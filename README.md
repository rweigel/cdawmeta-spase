# `cdawmeta-spase`

Metadata needed beyond that in CDF Masters and all.xml for the generation SPASE `NumericalData` descriptions for all CDAWeb datasets.

With this information and the `spase_auto` code in [`cdawmeta`](https://github.com/rweigel/cdawmeta), correct and consistent (with Masters and self) SPASE `NumericalData` records can be created for all CDAWeb datasets.

Completing the `DOI.json` and `ResourceID.json` files is the minimum requirement for having CDAWeb SPASE `NumericalData` records for all CDAWeb datasets.

Files in this repository are generated by [`report.py`](https://github.com/rweigel/cdawmeta/blob/main/report.py), which extracts (and corrects) certain attributes from existing SPASE records in the [`hpde.io` git repository](https://github.com/hpde/hpde.io/). See the log files in [reports](https://github.com/rweigel/cdawmeta-spase/tree/main/reports) for additional details on their method of generation, errors and inconsistencies encountered, and counts of attributes.

* [`AccessInformation.json`](AccessInformation.json) - is a template for `AccessInformation` nodes. Not all content applies to each dataset, and [`spase_auto.py`](https://github.com/rweigel/cdawmeta/blob/main/cdawmeta/generators/spase_auto.py) determines what parts to include based on information in Master CDFs.

* [`DOI.json`](DOI.json) - contains a list of DOI/CDAWeb dataset ID pairs.

* [`Epoch.json`](Epoch.json) - contains metadata that is important for interpretation of parameters derived from data in a CDF with a time `DataType`.

* [`InformationURL.json`](InformationURL.json) - contains keys of URLs found in `InformationURL` nodes and an array of associated CDAWeb dataset IDs. In some cases, a pattern (e.g., `^BAR_`) is used when we are certain that the `InformationURL/URL` applies to all CDAWeb dataset IDs matching that pattern.

* [`InstrumentID.json`](InstrumentID.json) contains SPASE InstrumentID/CDAWeb dataset IDs. There are ~20 CDAWeb datasets without SPASE Instrument IDs.

* [`ObservedRegion.json`](ObservedRegion.json) - Each key is the "spacecraft" part of a CDAWeb dataset ID (the part before the first `_`) and the values are all unique `ObservedRegion` values. There were many instances where different instruments on the same spacecraft had different `ObservedRegion` elements and we assumed that this was an error; the content of this file was created assuming all instruments were active at one time while the spacecraft was in each region. If this is not the case, extra nodes in the file can be added to indicate this.

* [`ResourceID.json`](ResourceID.json) - is a list of SPASE `ResourceID`/CDAWeb dataset ID pairs. There are many CDAWeb dataset IDs without SPASE `ResourceID`s. Also, there is inconsistency in the naming (e.g., `SWEPAM` data products are under `spase://VSPO` and `spase//NASA`).

* [`Rights.json`](Rights.json) - contains a placeholder template for anticipated additions to the SPASE metadata model to support FAIR.

* [`Units.json`](Units.json) - has an object with keys of `UNIT` strings found in CDF Masters that are not all whitespace. (We do not start with what was found in SPASE due to the mistranslation issues discussed in the `Units` section of the [`cdawmeta` repository README](https://github.com/rweigel/cdawmeta).) If not `null`, values are the [VOUnit](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/VOUnits/20231215/REC-VOUnits-1.1.html) equivalent. If `null`, a translation is needed. To the variables that have a unit string, search the CDAWeb [variable table](https://hapi-server.org/meta/cdaweb/variable/#UNITS='1/sec').

   For completion, the following is required:

   1. Determine the VOUnit representation of all unique units (~1000), when possible, in [`Units.json`](Units.json).

   2. Determine the VOUnit for all variables that do not have a `UNITS` or `UNIT_PTR` attribute or a unit value that is all whitespace (~20,000), which we label as "missing"; see [the log file](http://mag.gmu.edu/git-data/cdawmeta/data/master_resolved/master_resolved.errors.ISTP.UNITS.log). Although the [ISTP conventions](https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp_guide/vattributes.html#UNITS) require units for variables with `VAR_TYPE = data` and `support_data`, ~20% of variables have "missing" `UNITS`.

   3. Validate that determinations made for 1. and 2. are correct. This could done in two ways: (a) Have two people independently make the determinations and (b) for case 1., use AstroPy to compute the SI conversion and compare with the `SI_{conversion,conv,CONVERSION}` (all three versions are found in [CDF Masters](http://mag.gmu.edu/git-data/cdawmeta/data/table/cdaweb.variable.attribute_counts.csv) and the [ISTP convention documentation](https://github.com/rweigel/cdawmeta/issues/14)).

   Finally, we think that the correct source of the updated units is not SPASEâ€”it should be the CDF Masters; SPASE records should draw this information from the CDF Masters. Many people use CDF Masters for metadata, and if the VOUnits only existed in SPASE, they would have access to them. (For example, [CDAWeb](https://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/eval1.cgi?index=sp_phys&group=ACE) links to the Master file in the Metadata links and Autoplot, HAPI, etc. used Master CDF metadata.)
